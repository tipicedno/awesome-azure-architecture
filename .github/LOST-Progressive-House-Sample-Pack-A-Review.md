## How To Use It?
 
Now that you know what's inside the LOST Progressive House Sample Pack, you might be wondering how to use it in your own projects. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of this pack:

1. Tension Needs A Good Payoff In Progressive House: One of the main characteristics of progressive house is the contrast between the calm and atmospheric verses and the explosive and energetic drops. To create this effect, you need to build up tension in your verses using effects, filters, automation, and subtle changes in your elements. Then, you need to release that tension in your drops using powerful drums, basses, leads, and chords. A good way to do this is to use some of the effects from the pack, such as the downlifters and impacts, to create transitions between sections. You can also use some of the presets from the pack, such as the plucks and pads, to create melodic and harmonic interest in your verses. Then, you can switch to some of the leads and basses from the pack to create a strong contrast in your drops.
2. Prep Your Dance Floor For What Is To Come: Another important aspect of progressive house is to prepare your listeners for what is coming next. You want to give them hints and clues about what they can expect in the next section of your track. For example, if you are going to introduce a new lead or chord progression in your drop, you can tease it in your verse by using a low-pass filter or a volume automation. This way, you can create anticipation and excitement in your listeners. You can also use some of the drum loops from the pack to create variation and groove in your drums. You can layer them with your own drums or use them as they are. You can also chop them up and rearrange them to create your own patterns.
3. Kick Drums Are King: Full Stop: One of the most important elements in any dance music genre is the kick drum. It is the backbone of your track and it sets the tone and energy level for your whole production. In progressive house, you want a kick drum that is punchy, clear, and loud. You don't want a kick drum that is too boomy or muddy, as it will clash with your bass and other elements. You also don't want a kick drum that is too thin or weak, as it will not cut through the mix and drive your track forward. The LOST Progressive House Sample Pack contains some great kick drums that you can use in your tracks. They are already processed and ready to go. You can also tweak them further using EQ, compression, saturation, or distortion to make them fit your style and taste.
