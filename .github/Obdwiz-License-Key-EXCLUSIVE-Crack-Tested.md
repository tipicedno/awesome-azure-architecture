Microsoft has released a security update (KB4474419 - SHA-2 code signing support update) for Windows 7 operating system. This update enables Windows 7 to verify the authenticity of programs and drivers that are signed with SHA 2 certificates. SHA 2 certificates are more secure than the older SHA 1 certificates, which were deprecated on 15th April 2021 by Microsoft. Norton antivirus software will also switch to using SHA 2 certificates for code signing its product updates. This means that Windows 7 computers that do not have the security update installed will not be able to receive product updates from Norton that are above version 22.21.3. However, these computers will still receive security updates from Norton to protect them from malware and other threats.

Why is SHA 2 code signing important? Code signing is a process that ensures that the software you download or install is from a trusted source and has not been tampered with by malicious actors. Code signing uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the software publisher and to create a digital signature that is attached to the software. When you run the software, your operating system checks the digital signature against the certificate to make sure they match. If they do not match, it means that the software has been modified or corrupted and may be unsafe to use.
  
SHA 2 is a family of cryptographic hash functions that are used to create digital signatures. SHA 2 is more secure than SHA 1, which was found to have weaknesses that could allow attackers to create fake signatures. Microsoft has decided to stop supporting SHA 1 certificates for code signing on 15th April 2021, and has urged software publishers to switch to SHA 2 certificates. Norton has followed this recommendation and has started using SHA 2 certificates for its product updates.
