If you want to learn more about the new features and content of Age of Empires II HD: The Rise of the Rajas, here are some highlights:

- Four new civilizations: Burmese, Khmer, Malay, and Vietnamese. Each civilization has its own unique unit, technology, architecture, and bonuses. For example, the Burmese have the Arambai, a ranged cavalry unit that throws darts with high damage but low accuracy; the Khmer have the Ballista Elephant, a mounted scorpion that can fire two bolts at once; the Malay have the Karambit Warrior, a cheap and fast infantry unit that can swarm the enemy; and the Vietnamese have the Rattan Archer, a heavily armored archer that can resist enemy arrows.
- Four new campaigns: Gajah Mada, Suryavarman I, Bayinnaung, and LÃª Lá»£i. Each campaign follows the story of a historical hero from Southeast Asia and their struggles and achievements. For example, Gajah Mada was the prime minister of Majapahit who sought to unite the islands of Indonesia under one empire; Suryavarman I was the king of Khmer who restored his kingdom from chaos and built the magnificent Angkor Wat temple; Bayinnaung was the king of Burma who conquered most of Southeast Asia with his elephant army; and LÃª Lá»£i was the leader of the Vietnamese resistance against the Ming invasion.
- New generic units: Battle Elephant and Imperial Skirmisher. The Battle Elephant is a powerful cavalry unit that can crush enemy buildings and units with its trample damage. It is available to all four new civilizations as well as the Persians. The Imperial Skirmisher is an upgrade of the Elite Skirmisher that has improved stats and can counter archers more effectively. It is available to the Vietnamese and their allies.
- New maps: Bog Islands, Mangrove Jungle, Pacific Islands, and Sundarbans. These maps feature new terrains and environments that are inspired by Southeast Asia. For example, Bog Islands is a water map with islands surrounded by shallow water and marshes; Mangrove Jungle is a land map with dense forests and mangrove trees that can be chopped down; Pacific Islands is a water map with small islands and abundant fish and resources; and Sundarbans is a hybrid map with land and water areas separated by mangrove forests.
- New game modes: Treaty and Capture the Relic. Treaty is a game mode where players have a fixed amount of time to build up their economy and army before they can attack each other. Capture the Relic is a game mode where players have to capture and hold a relic in their monastery for a certain amount of time to win.
